# Creational-Patterns-Example
Simple example of creational patterns for studying purposes

## Problem

The problem Im solving with creational patterns is a Character creation menu.

This program is actually just a part of a bigger project (game) I made about creating characters who shoot each other.

In this previous project It would have been usefull to use a creational pattern. So I decided to a apply
the **Factory creational pattern** for the character creation part in the project.

## Program usage guide

Just run this program with a C# compiler.

This mini game menu program consist of:

-  An initial character creation.
-  A menu which lets the user choose to create more characters, to select another character that was created or to showcase the actual player in use.

Note: The default character in use is the initial character that is created at the start of the program.

## Documentation

This project was made trying to follow SOLID principles and I ended up with some classes to recolect the Character data that are easier
to understand with diagrams.

In this repository are images with a Classes diagram and a Sequence diagram of this program.
